# Course registration
## Add at least 3 Project features
- From my course registration you can select the course name and select the same course not multiple times
- You can select course credits from my course registration.
- You cannot take more than twenty hours of course credit.

## Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.
In my project useEffect is used once and useSate is used four times
- After loading the data with use effect, I put the data in the first use state, in which all the data of the gate function comes. Then we send the data with parameters in card.jsx then we show the data on the display.
- 2nd usestate apa.jsx declared when click on select button we get the data of this button and this data is dynamic.jsx Passing from here we are showing each course name on the display.
-2nd just like this , By using the third useState we were able to display the credit hours.
- 2nd Just like this, we are able to show the remaining hours display by making the fourth useState.
